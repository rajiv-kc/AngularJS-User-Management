OS: darwin x64
Angular: 
@angular-devkit/architect    0.13.9
@angular-devkit/core         7.3.9
@angular-devkit/schematics   7.3.9
@schematics/angular          7.3.9
@schematics/update           0.13.9
rxjs                         6.3.3

My first sample project with AngularJS. In this project I created very simple user management. It has a login page with hard code email and password to login. Add 5 sample users array and create list of users. Also added for Add, Edit and Delete with Browser storage.

To install project, download 'user-menagement' folder in your machine.Then run
# npm install

Above comment will create npm_modules folder and import all angular js files.

To start project
# ng serve

if you default port is already using for other project, start with new port.
# ng serve --port (your-new-port-number)
